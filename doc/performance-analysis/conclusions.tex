\section{Conclusions}

The primary outcomes of this work are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The application's main flaw is the Load Balance. As the load imbalance is algorithmic, the main suggestion for addressing this is adding support for the Dynamic Load Balancing library. This workaround needs of adding a shared memory parallelism layer such as OpenMP or OmpSs.
  \item The communication efficiency and instruction scalability are issues that need for further analysis. Nonetheless, the priority is de Load Balance. 
\end{itemize}
