\subsection{Staff}

\justify
The following roles are considered for developing the tasks described in the Gantt diagram.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Junior researcher.\textbf{Cost per hour: } 10 \euro / h
  \item Project manager. \textbf{Cost per hour:} 20.24 \euro / h
\end{itemize}

\justify
Table \ref{tab:staffcost} shows given the tasks and the time to complete defined in the Gantt the hours each role focus on and the cost.

\subsection{Material resources}

\justify
The estimate cost of the material resources are detailed in table \ref{tab:amort}. Mind that:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Cost and amortization of MareNostrum4 machine is not included as some of the data needed to calculate that must remain confidential.
  \item Some of the software used in the machine it is not free, neither as in freedom and as in beer. This cost is not included as it is also confidential. 
  \item The office costs are illustrative as the project is developed in the K2M building in Campus Nord.
  \item Lifetimes are calculated by considering a 8 hours per day use during 5 years for electronic devices and 10 years for the furniture. Usage time may differ from real usage due to COVID-19 global pandemic. 
\end{itemize}

Table \ref{tab:fix} shows the fixed monthly expenses. A final calculation on the part of the costs that are related to the project is added in a column. For example, if is a cost related to all the office users is divided by the number of the workers in the office.

\subsection{Contingencies}

\justify
It is estimated a 15\% of the total of the amortizations and the staff costs for any contingency we could encounter during the project development.
\begin{equation*}
  Cont=(Amort+Staff)*0.15=(7093+182.03)*0.15=1091.2545\ \euro
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Incidentals}

\justify
In the previous chapter we commented the possible incidentals. Table \ref{tab:inc} shows how the incidentals affect the budget.

\justify
We don't contemplate possible material costs associated to the MareNostrum 4 unavailable as it is the BSC the responsible of the machine maintenance and we are just users. 

\subsection{Total}

\justify
Table \ref{tab:tot} shows the grouped predicted budget of the whole project. Notice that from this cost we have omitted software licenses and compute hours costs which are confidential.
