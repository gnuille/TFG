For studying Alya as said we will use the POP methodology because:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The study is a POP service.
  \item It is a methodology promoted by an European Center of Excellence, meaning it is in the state-of-the-art of performance analysis methods and it is widely use in the academia.
  \item It is a well-known method and has been in part developed inside BSC.
  \item It is the methodology I have learnt during my formation period in BSC.
\end{itemize}

We will use the BSC toolset for extracting data to apply the POP methodology because:

\begin{itemize}
  \item They are well-integrated with the POP methodology.
  \item The tools are well-known and developed in BSC. In the situation that we find a bug or we have a problem using the tools, we can directly contact the application developers as they are co-workers.
  \item It is the toolset I have learnt during my formation period in BSC and during the computer engineering degree at PAR\footnote{Parallelism: \url{https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/bachelors-degrees/bachelor-degree-informatics-engineering/curriculum/syllabus/PAR}} subject.
\end{itemize}
