\chapter{Background}

This chapter introduces preliminary concepts needed to understand the work. We will take a look at:

\begin{itemize}
  \item High Performance Computing (HPC) environment basics.
  \item Alya and the combustion use case.
  \item Application analysis methodology.
\end{itemize}

At first, we will understand how an HPC environment works, and we will contextualize it within the BSC MareNostrum4 infrastructure, which is the target environment for the application. Therefore, we also will work in the same domain. Then an introductory study of Alya and a hands-on is done to understand how to work with the application. Finally, we will discuss the application analysis methodology giving detail about the steps and the concepts behind.
