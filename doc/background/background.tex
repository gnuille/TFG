\chapter{Background}

This chapter introduces general concepts needed to understand the work. We will take a look at:

\begin{itemize}
  \item High Performance Computing (HPC) environment basics.
  \item Alya and the combustion use case.
  \item Application analysis methodology.
\end{itemize}

At first, we will understand how an HPC environment works, and we will contextualize it within the BSC MareNostrum4 infrastructure, which is the target environment for the application. Then we introduce Alya, the HPC code we work with, and the use case we analyze and optimize in this project. Finally, we will discuss the application analysis methodology giving detail about the steps and the concepts behind.
