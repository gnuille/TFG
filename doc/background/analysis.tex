\section{Analysis}

As said in Section 3, we will follow the Performance Optimization and Productivity. The POP Efficiency metrics are the base of the methodology. First, we usually run the application many times in a \textit{strong scaling} manner. Strong scaling means leaving the problem's size constant and increasing the resources, for example, running the same Alya input set with 1, 2, 4 and Nodes. Then we gather necessary data for computing the efficiency metrics from the previous runs. Once we have the metrics, we possess insight into the factors limiting the code's performance when scaling in the number of resources. From this insight, we can locate the zones in the code responsible for it and try to propose a better implementation.
